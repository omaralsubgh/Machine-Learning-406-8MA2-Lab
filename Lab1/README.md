# ARTI406 - Machine Learning: Assignment 1
README: ARTI406 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Purpose:
This assignment focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)—the most critical step in the Machine Learning pipeline. The goal is to clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset to uncover patterns and prepare it for future modeling.

Dataset: Cristiano Ronaldo Club Goals
The file data.csv contains a complete record of goals scored by Cristiano Ronaldo across his club career (Sporting CP, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and Al-Nassr).

Key Features Analyzed:
Temporal Trends: Performance across different seasons and years.

Match Context: Scoring patterns based on Competition, Venue (Home/Away), and Opponent.

Technical Details: Analysis of goal types ( Headers, Penalties, Free Kicks) and playing positions (LW, CF, RW).

Assists: Data on teammates who provided the most goal assists.

Core EDA Objectives
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values (e.g., in the Goal_assist column) and standardizing date formats.

Visualization: Creating charts to show goal distribution by club and scoring method.

Insight Discovery: Identifying "clutch" performance (late-game goals) and career peaks.
